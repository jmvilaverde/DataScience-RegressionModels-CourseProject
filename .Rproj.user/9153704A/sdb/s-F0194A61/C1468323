Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:\n\n“Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”\n\"Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions\"\n\n\n##Question\n\nTake the mtcars data set and write up an analysis to answer their question using regression models and exploratory data analyses.\n\nYour report must be:\n\nWritten as a PDF printout of a compiled (using knitr) R markdown document.\nBrief. Roughly the equivalent of 2 pages or less for the main text. Supporting figures in an appendix can be included up to 5 total pages including the 2 for the main report. The appendix can only include figures.\nInclude a first paragraph executive summary.\nUpload your PDF by clicking the Upload button below the text box.\n\n##Peer Grading\n\nThe criteria that your classmates will use to evaluate and grade your work are shown below. \nEach criteria is binary: (1 point = criteria met acceptably; 0 points = criteria not met acceptably)\nYour Course Project score will be the sum of the points and will count as 40% of your final grade in the course. \n\n#Evaluation/feedback on the above work\n\n* Did the student interpret the coefficients correctly?\n* Did the student do some exploratory data analyses?\n* Did the student fit multiple models and detail their strategy for model selection?\n* Did the student answer the questions of interest or detail why the question(s) is (are) not answerable?\n* Did the student do a residual plot and some diagnostics?\n* Did the student quantify the uncertainty in their conclusions and/or perform an inference correctly?\n* Was the report brief (about 2 pages long) for the main body of the report and no longer than 5 with supporting appendix of figures?\n* Did the report include an executive summary?\n* Was the report done in Rmd (knitr)?\n\n##Report brief (about 2 pages)\n\n###Executive summary (First paragraph)\n\nAutomatic/Manual transmission is better...\n\n\n#### Data adquisition\n1.
